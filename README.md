# Academic Email Automation

## Smart Email Management System for Students using FastAPI, UiPath RPA, and LLMs

### Overview

It is an intelligent email-automation platform designed to help students manage the overwhelming volume of placement-related communication. Students at VIT receive dozens of emails every week containing recruitment announcements, deadlines, shortlists, and general academic notifications. Monitoring these manually is time-consuming and often leads to missed opportunities.

This system automates the entire workflow:

* Extracting emails
* Classifying important messages
* Performing eligibility checks
* Reading shortlist/selection attachments
* Summarising long emails using an LLM
* Generating ICS calendar invites via UiPath
* Displaying all results through a clean web interface

The solution integrates **UiPath RPA** for inbox automation and **FastAPI + SQLite + HTML/JS** for backend and frontend logic, creating a fully functional end-to-end academic email assistant.

# Project Motivation

Students are exposed to an overwhelming volume of daily emails, and manually identifying critical placement-related communication is inefficient and error-prone. Important details such as eligibility criteria, deadlines, interview schedules, and shortlists are often missed.

This project solves that problem by creating an automated system that transforms raw inbox data into **structured, actionable insights** that students can trust.

---

# Key Features

### 1. Automated Email Extraction (UiPath)

* Reads unread inbox emails
* Downloads and scans attachments
* Sends extracted data to backend for analysis

### 2. Intelligent Email Classification

Emails are automatically categorized into:

1. **New Company Announcement**
2. **Shortlist / Round Progression**
3. **Final Selection**
4. **General Academic Notices**

Classification uses both keyword logic and LLM-based semantic understanding.

### 3. Eligibility Checker

* Extracts CGPA, branch, 10th/12th marks from the user profile (SQLite)
* Compares with company criteria
* Displays “Eligible” / “Not Eligible” instantly

### 4. Excel Shortlist Processing

* Parses Excel sheets automatically
* Checks if student's name or registration number appears
* Works even when names are inside attachments

### 5. LLM-Based Email Summaries

Long announcements are summarized intelligently to quickly surface key information.

### 6. Calendar Automation (ICS Generation)

Via UiPath:

* Automatically identifies dates from emails
* Generates ICS files
* Sends them to student mailbox for one-click calendar import

### 7. Web Dashboard

Includes:

* Signup & login
* User profile view
* Dashboard showing categorized emails
* Embedded summaries, calendar buttons

# Architecture

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

```
                ┌──────────────┐

               ┌────────▼─────────┐

               └────────┬─────────┘
                        │
              ┌─────────▼──────────┐
              │   Web Frontend     │
              │  (HTML/CSS/JS)     │
              └────────────────────┘
```

Each component communicates seamlessly, forming a hybrid **RPA + AI-driven academic assistant**.

# UiPath Workflow Integration

Two main workflows are used:

### 1. **Email Extraction Bot**

* Reads student inbox
* Downloads Excel/PDF attachments
* Sends content to FastAPI using HTTP Request activity

### 2. **ICS Calendar Bot**

* Creates ICS file
* Sends it to student mailbox
* Triggered via backend request

The workflows correspond to `.nupkg` files included in the repo.

# Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

* Not yet deployed for large-scale multi-user usage
